# welcome to more data structers
## Task 0: Squared simple
**Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.**

1. Prototype: def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[])
2. matrix is a 2-dimensional array
3. Returns a new matrix:
    - Same size as matrix
    - Each value should be the square of the value of the input
    - The initial matrix should not be modified
4. You are not allowed to import any module
5. You are allowed to use regular loops, map, etc.
## Task 1: Search and replace
**Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.**

1. Prototype: def search_replace(my_list, search, replace)
2. my_list is the initial list
3. search is the element to replace in the list
4. replace is the new element
5. You are not allowed to import any module
## Task 2: Unique addition
**Write a function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer).**

1. Prototype: def uniq_add(my_list=[])
2. You are not allowed to import any module
## Task 3: Present in both
**Write a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.**

1. Prototype: def common_elements(set_1, set_2)
2. You are not allowed to import any module
## Task 4: Only differents
**Write a function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.**

1. Prototype: def only_diff_elements(set_1, set_2)
2. You are not allowed to import any module
## Task 5: Number of keys
**Write a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.**

1. Prototype: def number_keys(a_dictionary)
2. You are not allowed to import any module
## Task 6: Print sorted dictionary
**Write a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.**

1. Prototype: def print_sorted_dictionary(a_dictionary)
2. You can assume that all keys are strings
3. Keys should be sorted by alphabetic order
Only sort keys of the first level (don't sort keys of a dictionary inside the main dictionary)
4. Dictionary values can have any type
5. You are not allowed to import any module
## Task 7: Update dictionary
**Write a function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.**

1. Prototype: def update_dictionary(a_dictionary, key, value)
2. key argument will always be a string
3. value argument will be any type
4. If a key exists in the dictionary, the value will be replaced
5. If a key doesn't exist in the dictionary, it will be created
6. You are not allowed to import any module
## Task 8: Simple delete by key
**Write a function that deletes a key in a dictionary.**

1. Prototype: def simple_delete(a_dictionary, key="")
2. key argument will always be a string
3. If a key doesn't exist, the dictionary won't change
4. You are not allowed to import any module
## Task 9: Multiply by 2
**Write a function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2.**

1. Prototype: def multiply_by_2(a_dictionary)
2. You can assume that all values are only integers
3. Returns a new dictionary
4. You are not allowed to import any module
## Task 10: Best score
**Write a function that returns a key with the biggest integer value.**

1. Prototype: def best_score(a_dictionary)
2. You can assume that all values are only integers
3. If no score is found, return None
4. You can assume all students have a different score
You are not allowed to import any module
