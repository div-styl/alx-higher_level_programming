## 0-Run Python file:
**The purpose of this task is to create a shell script that can execute a Python script specified by the user.**

- Write a shell script that runs a Python script.
- The Python file name will be saved in the environment variable $PYFILE.

## 1-Run inline:

**The purpose of this task is to create a shell script that can execute inline Python code provided by the user.**

- Write a shell script that runs Python code.
- The Python code will be saved in the environment variable $PYCODE.

## 2-Hello, print:

**The purpose of this task is to write a simple Python script that prints a specific phrase.**

- Write a Python script that prints the phrase "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" followed by a new line.

## 3-Print integer:

**The purpose of this task is to complete a Python script that prints a float with a specific precision, stored in a variable.**

- Complete the given Python source code to print the integer stored in the variable number, followed by "Battery street", and a new line.
Do not cast the variable number into a string.
- Use f-strings.

## 4-Print float:

**The purpose of this task is to complete a Python script that prints a string multiple times, followed by a subset of its characters.**

- Complete the given Python source code to print the float stored in the variable number with a precision of 2 digits.
- Use f-strings.

## 5-Print string:

**The purpose of this task is to complete a Python script that prints a string multiple times, followed by a subset of its characters.**

- Complete the given Python source code to print the string stored in the variable str three times, followed by its first 9 characters.
- Do not use loops or conditional statements.
- The program should be a maximum of 5 lines long.

## 6-Play with strings:

**The purpose of this task is to complete a Python script that prints a specific phrase without using loops or conditional statements, and keeping the script exactly 5 lines long.**

- Complete the given Python source code to print the phrase "Welcome to Holberton School!".
- Do not use loops or conditional statements.
- The program should be exactly 5 lines long.
## 7-Copy - Cut - Paste:

**The purpose of this task is to complete a Python script that extracts specific parts of a given word and stores them in separate variables, without using loops or conditional statements.**

- Complete the given Python source code to extract specific parts of the variable word and store them in three separate variables.
- The variable word_first_3 should contain the first 3 letters of word.
- The variable word_last_2 should contain the last 2 letters of word.
- The variable middle_word should contain the value of word without the first and last letters.
- Do not use loops or conditional statements.
- The program should be exactly 8 lines long.

## 8-Create a new sentence:

**The purpose of this task is to complete a Python script that prints a specific phrase without creating new variables, using string literals, or using loops or conditional statements.**

- Complete the given Python source code to print the phrase "object-oriented programming with Python", followed by a new line.
- Do not use loops or conditional statements.
- The program should be exactly 5 lines long.
- Do not create new variables.
- Do not use string literals.

## 9-Easter Egg:

**The purpose of this task is to write a Python script that prints a specific phrase along with additional lines of text, demonstrating a hidden or special feature.**

- Write a Python script that prints "The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters" followed by several lines of text.
- The script should be a maximum of 98 characters long.

## 10-Linked list cycle:

**The purpose of this task is to write a C function that checks if a singly linked list contains a cycle, using the provided function prototype and restricted set of allowed functions.**

- Write a C function that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.
- The function should have the prototype int check_cycle(listint_t *list).
- It should return 0 if there is no cycle, and 1 if there is a cycle.
- Only use the allowed functions: write, printf, putchar, puts, malloc, and free.

## 11-Hello, write (Advanced):

**The purpose of this task is to write a Python script that prints a specific phrase to the standard error (stderr) without using the print function and with a specific exit status code.**

- Write a Python script that prints the phrase *"and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19"* to stderr.
- The script should not use the print function.
- The script should exit with a status code of 1.

## 12-Compile (Advanced):

**The purpose of this task is to write a script that compiles a Python script file specified by the user, creating a compiled bytecode file without any output to the standard output (stdout).**

- Write a script that compiles a Python script file.
- The Python file name will be stored in the environment variable $PYFILE.
- The output filename should be $PYFILEc (e.g., if $PYFILE is my_script.py, the output filename should be my_script.pyc).
- The script should print nothing to stdout.
## 13. ByteCode -> Python #1
A Shell script that compiles a Python script file. The Python file name is stored in the environment variable ``$PYFILE``
